# Todo

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.4.

## Development server<img width="979" height="545" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-15 145931" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31e57a5f-8f5e-4556-9201-204e99ad55fb" />


To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```![Uploading Screenshot 2025-10-15 145931.pngâ€¦]()


Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
